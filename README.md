<h1>Sticky Bees Maze</h1>

<p>In this project, I created a webpage with interactive elements. The main structure includes a video background that plays on loop, buttons for "Solve" and "Reset" with interactive functions, and several graphic elements like images and animations.</p>

<p>Specifically, I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up the HTML structure with all necessary links to styles and video files.</li>
  <li>Designed and positioned buttons with unique shapes and hover animations.</li>
  <li>Added a logo and video background for a more dynamic visual effect.</li>
  <li>Styled the page using CSS for elements like buttons, logos, images, and backgrounds.</li>
  <li>Built the layout using a flexible design to ensure proper display across different devices.</li>
</ul>
