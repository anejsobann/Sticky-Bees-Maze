<h1>Sticke Bees Maze</h1>

In this project, I created a webpage with interactive elements. The main structure includes a video background that plays on loop, buttons for "Solve" and "Reset" with interactive functions, and several graphic elements like images and animations.

Specifically, I:

Set up the HTML structure with all necessary links to styles and video files.
Designed and positioned buttons with unique shapes and hover animations.
Added a logo and video background for a more dynamic visual effect.
Styled the page using CSS for elements like buttons, logos, images, and backgrounds.
Built the layout using a flexible design to ensure proper display across different devices.
